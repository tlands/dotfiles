When I get the motivation after work ( or a swift kick in the ass) I will make a lil script so one can install zsh/tmux/vim and of course my dotfiles (which will probably only be me).

Lots of these shortcuts/key remappings were found while perusing other dev's dotfiles... and some are mine too. It's just personal preference. Color Rules Everything Around Me (syntax highlighting, ya bish)
