Easiest way to set this up is to clone this repo into a dir (prefix with a . ie .dotfiles) then symlink them to your root so that they'll be loaded up accordingly. ie ln -s .dotfiles/vim .vim 
Lots of these shortcuts/key remappings were found while perusing other dev's dotfiles... and some are mine too.
